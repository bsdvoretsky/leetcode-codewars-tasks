# 886. Possible Bipartition

https://leetcode.com/problems/possible-bipartition/description/

We want to split a group of `n` people (labeled from `1` to `n`) into two groups of **any size**. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.

Given the integer `n` and the array `dislikes` where `dislikes[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that the person labeled `a_i` does not like the person labeled `b_i`, return `true` *if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way*.
